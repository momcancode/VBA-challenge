# VBA challenge - The VBA of Wall Street


## Where is the data from?

The data is provided by Monash University Data Analytics Bootcamp.

## What did I do?

* Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

* Return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume".

* Make the appropriate adjustments to the VBA script that will allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.
